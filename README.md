# About me
Hi!  My name is Mirelle (she/her) and I'm a graduate student here at Heinz College, studying Public Policy & Management (Flagship Track) with a concentration in Environmental Policy. 

# What I hope to learn
I'm interested in climate and sustainability and hope to use data visualization skills to create more informative and engaging policy work. After graduation, I would like to work for an environmental nonprofit or think tank.
