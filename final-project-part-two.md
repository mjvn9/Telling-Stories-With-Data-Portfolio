# Wireframes

I expanded on my initial sketches into high-fidelity wireframes and organized them in Shorthand to preview the structure of the final piece. The current wireframe draft can be found here: [Shorthand Draft](https://preview.shorthand.com/zMqI3hwpmJA11u8J).

The sections below describe key components and how they support the overall narrative.

# User Research 

## Target Audience
> This project is designed for two main groups who interact with information about flood risk in different ways:

1. **NYC emergency management and planning staff**  
   These professionals make decisions about preparedness, investments, and long-term resilience planning. They need visualizations that highlight where critical facilities such as hospitals, schools, fire stations, and public housing overlap with areas of high flood vulnerability so they can prioritize resources effectively.

2. **Manhattan residents**  
   Community members may not know whether the essential services they rely on are located in flood-prone areas. A clear, accessible map can help residents understand vulnerabilities in their own neighborhood and what types of facilities could be affected during severe flooding.

> Approach to Identifying Participants

To collect feedback that reflects these audiences, I spoke with three individuals who represent the types of users I hope to reach:

- A **Manhattan resident** who lives near the East River and has some personal awareness of flooding concerns.
- A **public policy student** familiar with data storytelling who could comment on clarity and narrative flow.
- A  **former coworker enrolled in an urban planning course**, who understands basic spatial analysis but is not a specialized expert.

Each conversation lasted under 10 minutes and focused on whether the story made sense, how understandable the maps were, and what felt confusing/incomplete.

## Interview Script

For my interviews, I developed a script focused on clarity and narrative flow. The goal was to understand how well the visuals communicate the story and room for improvement, or where viewers might feel confused or need context. These questions are designed to test both the individual charts and the coherence of the overall story.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Test story sequence | Does the progression of visuals feel natural and easy to follow? |
| Assess map clarity | Is it clear what the colors represent? Does the legend help? |
| Evaluate infrastructure overlays | Do the symbols make sense, or do they feel too busy? |
| Identify hotspots | Can you easily spot neighborhoods that look particularly at-risk? |
| Check accessibility | Would someone without mapping or data experience understand this? | 
| Check supporting charts | Do the bar chart and pie chart help clarify the story or do they feel extra? | 


## Interview Findings

Below is a condensed summary of the feedback from all three interviews, organized by question.

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Story sequence | Clear. Liked starting “clean” before adding data. | Liked the structure, but wanted short text transitions between visuals. | Said it felt aligned to how city agencies present risk. |
| Map clarity | Understood it but wasn’t sure whether dark = danger or prevalence. | Suggested adding a 1-sentence definition of the Index. | Wanted labels on 2–3 specific high-risk neighborhoods. |
| Infrastructure overlays | “Really helpful” but mentioned that points might overlap too much. | Thought the legend symbols were too small. | Suggested grouping certain types of infrastructure if they become crowded. |
| Hotspots | Easily pointed out Lower East Side & Financial District. | Same, but asked if medium-risk areas also count as “at-risk.” | Suggested emphasizing the East River side more clearly. |
| Supporting charts | Bar chart “very clear.” | Bar chart better than pie chart. Pie felt slightly crowded. | Wanted exact numbers on the bar chart for clarity. |
| Pain points | Wanted neighborhood names on the map. | Asked for clearer wording around “at-risk.” | Wanted a quick explanation of why those four facility types matter specifically. |

# Identified Changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uncertainty about what “high flood vulnerability” means | Add a short explanation of the Flood Vulnerability Index. |
| Desire for clearer legends | Increase legend size, reduce symbol clutter, and directly label the gradient. |
| Crowding: of points and of pie chart elements | Consider using transparency for overlapping points, consider simplifying pie chart elements. |
| Viewers unsure what counts as “at-risk” | Add a definition, such as facilities located in “high” zones only or “high + medium.” |
| Missing transitions | Add 1–2 sentence narrative bridges between visuals in Shorthand. |

The interviews confirmed that the core story is working well and the maps communicate the right ideas. The next phase will be mostly about polishing. This includes legends, explanations, and terminology.
